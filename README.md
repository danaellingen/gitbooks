# gitbooks

Dana's gitbooks, which will include:

* quasi-formatted lists, both

* numbered and

* bulleted

* with **bold text** made with double asterisks and _italic text_ made with underscores

* Problems:

  * 1. Don't know how to get at the raw HTML
    2. so I can't go back and change edits.
